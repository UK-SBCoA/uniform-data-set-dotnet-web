# UDS for .NET

This repository includes all necessary tools to electronically collect data for UDS including

* UDS instruments as HTML forms (additionally, packaged with Nuget)
* QC rules
* Data persistence
* Development container
* Production container

This software is intended for use by [National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dn/national-alzheimers-coordinating-center-nacc) (ADRCs) to collect data for submission to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center ([NACC](https://naccdata.org/)) database. This data set is called UDS (Uniform Data Set). All ADRC's submit this data to contribute to the NIA's Alzheimer's Disease Longitudinal Study.

The software is implemented with several .NET tools and includes a development container for ease of use. You may choose to use the provided container or simply deploy the production container to your cloud storage provider.

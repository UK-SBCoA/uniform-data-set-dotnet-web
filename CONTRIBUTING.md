# You are a hero

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository. It's people like you that will help us end aging diseases like Alzheimer's.

### History

This codebase was originally funded by an NIH grant, and to continue to maintain it we need community contributions from people like you! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports in the [issue tracker](../../issues) and feature requests in [Discussions](../../discussions), adding localization translations for other languages, or writing code and submitting a PR.

### Support questions

Please, don't use the issue tracker or discussions for **support questions**. Email us or submit a request in our helpdesk ticketing system.

### Reporting issues

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email svc_COAHelpdesk@uky.edu instead.

Include the following information in your issue:

* Describe what you expected to happen
* If possible, include a minimal reproducible example to help us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
* Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an exception.

### Your First Contribution

Look through GitHub issues for bugs or enhancements. Anything tagged with `good first issue` is open to whoever wants to implement it. Do not combine multiple issues into a single pull request.

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials to get started: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

### Code review process

Our team reviews Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given we expect repsonses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

Thank you to our community. We couldn't do this without you.
